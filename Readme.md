Hey friends😊,

Here with another JavaScript Project 

🔴FEATURES🔴

🍭 A simple UI-based  Calculator with a gradient background and some cool-looking styling with HTML and CSS.

🍭Corely based on the concepts of JavaScript such as DOM manipulation and addEventListeners.

🍭A Function call executed on every change made to the Input Fields and calculates the EMI based on this formula: EMI = [P x R x (1+R)^N]/[(1+R)^N-1]

🍭Additionally used concepts like parseFloat() for the conversion of a string to a floating point number, parseInt() for the conversion of a string into an integer

& Math.pow() for raised to the power calculations.
